                <p>Animal cruelty by definition is the infliction of harm against animals, this entails a variety of acts, including everything from neglect to ill-intentioned killing.</p>
                <p>Neglect involves depriving animals of food, water, shelter, socialization and veterinary care. This may also mean hoarding them.</p>
                <p>Ill-intentioned killing encompasses torturing, maiming, mutilating and murdering an animal.</p>

                <p>From 5000 BC - 500 AD, animals were used as machines. They pulled things such as sleds with blocks of limestone and plows. In the wars, they were used as weapons and vehicles. An example for this would be Hannibal's use of elephants and cattle as diversions during his conquests. In Rome, they were used as entertainment in the colosseum, in which they were treated badly. These animals were put below the arena, then later slaughtered, used against criminals or starved.</p>

                <p>From the years 500-1400, or the middle ages, animals were blamed for many human illnesses. Those that spread the plague, like the cats and dogs, were hunted and burned. During Special Occasions, they were used as bait for entertainment. The unfortunate animal, such as a bull or bear, was subject to attack by a pack of trained dogs. Like how they would execute people, they would execute animals, like roaming pigs, accused of crimes.</p>

                <p>In the 15th to 17th century Renaissance, people learned to domesticate livestock. Men also did a lot of trophy hunting. Cats and dogs were still accused of spreading the plague even though it was the rats who were the cause, leading to 3720 of them to be killed in May of 1636. Even with the major developments of this time, animals were still not cared for.</p>

                <p>A hint of awareness on animal cruelty was brought to light in the Enlightenment period of 1600-1800 by Michel de Montaigne, but even the thought of animals being able to feel pain was brushed aside by other philosophers such as Rene Descartes. People still continued to treat animals inhumanely, they also began to take animals from the wild and train them to be street performers.</p>

                <img id="Modern" src="https://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/animalabuse640.jpg">
                <p>In the Modern Era of 1800-2000, animal welfare was taken more seriously. Acts prohibiting the mistreatment of pet or domesticated animals were passed. This did not do much to stop the abuse, animals were still treated like machines, especially those found in farms.</p>
