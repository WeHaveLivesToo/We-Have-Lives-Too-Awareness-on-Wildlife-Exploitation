            <h2>Sea World</h2>

            <p>They take orcas, belugas, dolphins and other creatures from their natural habitat to use as entertainment. According to PETA, 'While wild female orcas can live to be more than 100 years old, orcas at SeaWorld often die by the time they reach their teens and rarely approach even the average life expectancy of wild orcas. More than 40 orcas have died at SeaWorld from causes such as bacterial infections and fractured skulls. More than 300 other dolphins and whales along with approximately 400 pinnipeds have also died at the parks.</p>

            <p>This Establishment in Canada also has a terrible record for its treatment of animals. Including disgusting mass graves and illegal disposing of corpses at Niagara falls. 'The park also has a long history of obtaining wild-caught beluga whales, dolphins, and orcas, including Keiko, aka 'Willy' from the movie Free Willy, whom Marineland sold to an even more depressing park in Mexico, where he languished for years before being rescued and rehabilitated. This summer, Demers and seven other former trainers came forward to report numerous instances of neglect and abuse, including serious damage to animals skin and eyes because of filthy, tainted water.' (Mullins, 2012)</p>
        
            
            <h2>Cayman Turtle Center</h2>

            <p>Located in the Cayman Islands, this is the last sea turtle farm that acts as a tourist attraction. Tourists may hold and eat turtles during their visit, unfortunately, these stress the animals out. The tourists are unaware that the turtles are endangered, and that they panic when humans hold them. They often drop the turtles, causing potentially fatal injuries.</p>

            <p>The popular attraction has always hurt animals. The supposedly wild animals have hurt themselves, and others trying to get away. They're not supposed to be in tanks.</p>
