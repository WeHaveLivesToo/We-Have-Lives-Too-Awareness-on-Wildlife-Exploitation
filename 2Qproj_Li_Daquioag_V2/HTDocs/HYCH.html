                <h1>Support Sanctuaries, Not Zoos</h1>
                <img id="SSZ" src="https://d15kbsmiqz0zlr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/elephant-sanctuaries-featured-1200x720.jpg">
                
                <p>Sanctuaries are there only to care for animals that canâ€™t be released to the wild because of certain medical or behavioral issues. They may allow people to see the animals but they do not use the animals as entertainment on purpose. Sanctuaries do their best to provide the animals with all their needs, with the least human interaction they can, and if possible, rehabilitate the animals so that they can be released back to the wild.</p>
                
                <p>Zoos, Carnivals and Aquariums put animals into stressful conditions under the guise of conservation efforts, that become useless because they never release the animals into the wild or inbreed the animals too much that they have genetic defects. The training they do to these animals is too stressful, and the punishments are cruel. They take animals from the wild, unnecessarily, and make them into entertainment commodities or business assets.</p>

                <img id="Enlightenment" src="https://www.montanatrappers.org/images/fur-auction.jpg">
                <p>Fur/Skin products aren't chic because animals were slain cruelly so they could be acquired, in the previous page, it was shown why these products do so much harm to the animals.</p>

                <p>Use what you know to inform others, a mere shared post or signed petition can actually be a lot of help. Familiarise yourelf with the laws that allow you to fight for the rights of these creatures.</p>
                
                <p>Volunteer at shelters, conservation centers or sanctuaries. The non-profit organisations that help these animals often rely on the help of volunteers, like the Big Cat Rescue.</p>
